### 3. Why choose `NativeScript`?

`NativeScript` is pretty more better than `React Native`, you can call platform's API from JavaScript without writing Native  Code. This advantage makes `NativeScript` better than `React Native`!!!

> ***NativeScript APIs***

> ***Developers can call platform APIs from JavaScript instead of writing native code with Objective-C or Kotlin. This is where NativeScript has an advantage over React Native because JavaScript developers don't need expertise in a specific platform language to work with Native APIs.***
