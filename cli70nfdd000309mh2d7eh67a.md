Hey folks! Thanks for reading my article, today I'm going to talk about how using the Hashnode AI has helped me in writing articles and saving time.

So without further wasting time, let's start diving into the content! üêã

## How Hashnode AI affected my blog

Hashnode AI can help in writing your article by providing SEO-friendly content/titles, it generates awesome introductions and outros since I started using Hashnode AI, I have noticed that the articles that I used Hashnode AI to write, got more views than other articles that have been written without using the Hashnode AI.

## How Hashnode AI affected me

Hashnode AI has helped me to save time in writing articles, also I have been using Rix, it's an AI chatbot that can help me while coding JavaScript, TypeScript, and more!

Although it is still under development and it might provide misleading responses, sometimes it provides helpful responses, also Hashnode AI helped me to write articles, and it can write for me sections that Hashnode AI is capable of writing, for example, Hashnode AI might have written the section of **Debugging Tools Based on AI** in my article of [**The Future of Debugging with AI and Machine Learning**](https://omardevblog.toolsandapps4us.site/the-future-of-debugging-with-ai-and-machine-learning#heading-debugging-tools-based-on-ai), the Hashnode AI might have written it, but I might have to double-check if the provided tools are available and providing the debugging experience with AI and Machine Learning or not.

## Is paying for Hashnode AI worth it?

Hashnode AI's pricing is pretty good for $7/month, although for students who just consider coding as a hobby and don't generate an income, it might be a barrier for some, if you write a lot and you care about your stats and your time, I recommend you really should subscribe, while Hashnode Pro doesn't provide access to Hashnode AI only, while it provides Priority Support from Hashnode and more!

## Thanks for reading!

Thanks for reading my article, I hope you learned more about Hashnode AI, and have considered whether to subscribe or not, thanks for your time, and have a nice day!

Cheers! üéâ
