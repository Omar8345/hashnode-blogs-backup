## Cloud platforms - Why choose AWS?

Hey there, wherever whom you are and where you are, welcome to this article.

As you had stepped into here, you should be interested about what cloud platform to choose and why especially choose **AWS**! Doesn't matter you are a business owner, developer, or just a student, this article is guaranteed to help üòÄ.

So, without wasting my time and yours's too, let's start!

## Cloud platform

### What is a cloud platform

A cloud platform refers to "***the operating system and hardware of a server in an Internet-based data center***". They are like a large place which contains many computers used by personal and enterprise users.

### Types of a cloud platform

There are several types of cloud platforms which fits for different purposes. Which includes:

 - **Public Cloud:** Public cloud platforms are third-party service providers that provide computing resources and more over the internet. Examples are like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and DigitalOcean.

 - **Private Cloud:** A private cloud platform is made exclusively for a single organization, or maybe a single person, which no one other uses it except you or your organization. It's usually hosted (on-site | at your org) or sometimes hosted by a third-party service provider.

 - **Hybrid Cloud:** Hybrid Cloud is a combination between a **Private** and **Public** cloud platforms. Both data and applications seamlessly pass between the two (private and public), which gives the organization more flexibility.

### Uses of cloud platforms

Here, we'll just pass an example, and you can seamlessly understand the rest. We are talking about that I have a company/shop website which I would like to host it on the internet. Let's say I own resources which are enough to host the website and make it fast and such on, and I don't want to use them, or you can also say that you don't have enough resources to host the website and need to buy the needed resources with someone who should maintain them and keep them up-to-date.

Here comes the work of a cloud platform, there are many cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and last but not least DigitalOcean, I recommend AWS, we'll know why later on. AWS has a data center, with many computers (large computers which can do things that a normal computer couldn't do), you can rent a resources from AWS or the cloud platform you prefer by using 2 common plans:

- 1. Pay-as-you-go is a common plan which you can pay as you use the resources, will never stop unless reaches the limit of money you set or when you manually set it.

- 2. And another way to pay is to buy limited use of the resources, which means you will buy a resources and use it like for example host a website, and your bandwidth will be let's say 10 GB, when your bandwidth reaches 0, the resources will stop.

Now we are done of cloud platforms story, let's get on why choose AWS.

## Why choose AWS?

**AWS** is a cloud platform, and it is the best cloud platform in the market with the most highest growth.

AWS certifications are also well-trusted by big tech companies.

### 2. Recovery System

Another of the most valuable AWS benefits is its disaster recovery system. Custom software development companies offer a solution to recover lost data so that your day-to-day-to-day operations aren't affected.

### 3. Better Security

AWS, as a cloud service, offers enchanted security to protect your virtual org. The data centers and servers have multiple layers of operational security. The Amazon detective makes security monitoring faster and more reliable.

### 4. Multi-region Backups

So even when your primary operational environment goes offline, your backup will not have any impact. You can also schedule backups across different regions.

### 5. Scalability Factor

One of the top AWS advantages is its pricing model. AWS platform works on the pay-as-you-go pricing model. You don‚Äôt have to pay heavy subscription fees for resources that you won‚Äôt even use. The flexible pricing structure drastically improves the organizational bottom line, keeping cloud computing affordable for you.

### 7. Flexibility

Finally, one of the most important AWS benefits is its flexibility. It enables you to select your operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services that you may need. AWS offers a virtual environment to load all the services that your application may require. It also simplifies the data migration process.
