# Can someone tell you 'I had MASTERED Python and I know everything'

## Of course you had heard this sentence before, and if you didn't, it's not a problem, but let's complete!

### Umm, so let's discuss and have our final answer. We won't show you now so we can grab your *interest!*

Let's Start!

Actually, everyone knows Python is a programming language from across about 7000 languages! Think of it, it's ***almost incredible!*** Actually everyone also knows that Python is growing quickly. Right ? Now, here is a question!

### What type of growth that is Python Growing ? (Umm?)

Although most people think it is in the language in it's growth of the code and libraries and like that, actually the answer is ***FALSE*** .

The ***Correct*** answer is that it does grow in the type of programmers count, it's well known and such more like that.

So if someone tells you 'I had MASTERED Python and I know everything.' It might be correct! And this mostly also is same with other languages such as JavaScript & CSS.

So I hoped you got it.
