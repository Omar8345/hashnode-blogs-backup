## Why didn't I introduce myself?

### Hi 'n hello!

How are you?

How do you do? How 'd you do? And how 'd you do again? I am pleased to introduce myself to you today

### Introduction

I'm Omar Mostafa, **AKA as Amoora**. I'm a programmer and designer, also as you can also note a blogger on **Hashnode**. I started *programming* from **small age, around 10 years old *officially*ðŸ¤£**. 

### Fun area #1

**Just to know, I am currently 13 ðŸ˜…, interested in programming since 6 years old**

### Why I started programming?

You know, **everyone has free-time ðŸ¤£**, if not, *tell me a person you know who doesn't have free-time in the comments below*, **just beat me if you can't find one, because you can't actually ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£**. *Back again to our idea*, I dived into **programming to find something to do in my free-time**. *To be honest, **I didn't discover programming alone, but I was interested and sticked with technology and computers, who introduced me and told me about programming was my -father***

### Fun area #2

> ***Talk is cheap. Show me the code***

> *Linus Torvalds*

### The end ðŸ¥³

## Sorry for making this blog pretty short, but I hope it was a brief introduction about myself!

### And a shoutout, hey @[Miki Szeles](@mszeles), any comments?
