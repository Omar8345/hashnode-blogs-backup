## Why didn't I introduce myself?

### Hi 'n hello!

How are you?

How do you do? How 'd you do? And how 'd you do again? I am pleased to introduce myself to you today

### Introduction

I'm Omar Mostafa, **AKA as Amoora**. I'm a programmer and designer, also as you can also note a blogger on **Hashnode**. I started *programming* from **small age, around 10 years old *officially*🤣**. 

### Fun area #1

**Just to know, I am currently 13 😅, interested in programming since 6 years old**

### Why I started programming?

You know, **everyone has free-time 🤣**, if not, *tell me a person you know who doesn't have free-time in the comments below*, **just beat me if you can't find one, because you can't actually 🤣🤣**. *Back again to our idea*, I dived into **programming to find something to do in my free-time**. *To be honest, **I didn't discover programming alone, but I was interested and sticked with technology and computers, who introduced me and told me about programming was my -father*** And also, I know, **jobs in the future will be replaced by robots, and to make robots we need programmers, so I became a programmer 😅, too 🤣**


### Fun area #2

> ***Talk is cheap. Show me the code.***

> *Linus Torvalds*

### Why I started blogging?

Before, I was chatting with friends on **Discord**, they are most programmers like me, most of them were with me joined in my friend's company called **Jiusoft**, one of them was @[Jothin kumar](@jothin), who is currently the **CEO** of **Jiusoft** and I am the **Co-Founder** of **Jiusoft**. One day, he messaged me in a happy mood and dancing, sending me a screenshot of an email coming from **Ayush**, *community manager* at **Tealfeed**, **Tealfeed** is *blogging platform like **Hashnode***.  Saying that *He emailed him to get his blog promoted on Tealfeed, as he read on of his amazing blogs on Hashnode*. *Also, he got an opportunity to join a team of programmers for **open-source**! So **without saying any-word, I said *I should register on Hashnode 𝚝̶𝚘̶𝚍̶𝚊̶𝚢̶, 𝚊̶𝚏̶𝚝̶𝚎̶𝚛̶ ̶𝚏̶𝚎̶𝚠̶ ̶𝚑̶𝚘̶𝚞̶𝚛̶𝚜̶, now!*** **Went to Hashnode.com, sign up, and write my first blog, and after my first 3-5 blogs, which was after about 2-3 weeks, I got the same email from Ayush to promote my blogs on Tealfeed! So blogging is amazing to become one of your hobbies and even gets you opportunities, even it might get your dream job!**

### The end 🥳
