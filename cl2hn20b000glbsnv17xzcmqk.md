## Before we start, a special thanks to @[Miki Szeles](@mszeles) for making this tool - To be honest, it helped me - a lot

### What is Selenideium Element Inspector - What does "Selenideium Element Inspector" do?

**Selenideium Element Inspector** helps you save time automating tests using:

- `Selenide`

- `Selenium`

- `Cypress`

- `Playwright`

- `TestCafe`

- `Squish`

Ok, now - what does that tool do?

Son, this extension helps you to automagically generate complete line of copy-pastable selector code by simply clicking on an element - is there any better thing than that?!
