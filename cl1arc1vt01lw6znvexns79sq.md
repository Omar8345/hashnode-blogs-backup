### What is Windows 11?

Windows 11 is one of the twelve editions (*versions*) of **The Microsoft Windows O-S Family ðŸ˜…**, as like if we have a special pen called **Peny-Pen**, which has 3 editions, *Peny-Pen Red* 'n *Peny-Pen Blue* 'n finally *Peny-Pen Green* :).

So Microsoft said that *Windows 11* will be the latest and last version of Windows and they will work on updating it only forever, until *the nice Windows 10 gets out of support ðŸ¤£*


---------------------------------------------------

### When was Windows 11 released?

Windows 11 was released on October 5, 2021. Most people didn't like that, some did, too. Sorry Microsoft for saying that ðŸ˜…, but that has been analyzed by my super programming analysis ðŸ¤£. Check this joke!

### Linux is calling ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…
