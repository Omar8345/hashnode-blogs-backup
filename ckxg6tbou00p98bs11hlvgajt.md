If you haven't realized yet, both Python & Java are very distinct programming languages. The above picture gives a hint at their key differences --> Python is **well-known for being incredibly simple & concise**, on the other hand, Java is **known for it's many lines of more complex code**. The outcome can be the same in both languages, but in the world of development it's how you get there, that matters a lot!

Python:

Python is an older language of the two languages, it was developed in 1991 by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. Python is an object-oriented programming language with vast libraries, which helps with implementing Python-based programs and algorithms too.

**Object-Oriented Programming or OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.**

**Python is the fastest growing programming language in the whole world...**

Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that Python‚Äôs interpreter type checks code while the code is running, rather than before.

Python is also an interpreted language, meaning that it executes each command line by line. Interpreted programming languages are generally more flexible, and allow users features such as dynamic typing and smaller program size.

This is where the biggest difference between Python and Java lies. While Python is a dynamically typed, interpreted language, Java is a compiled + interpreted, statically-typed language. This means that its source code is initially compiled into a binary byte code before then being run through an interpreter.

Java:

Java was developed in 1995 by James Gosling and has found enormous popularity - holding its place as the top 1 or 2 programming language ever since.

But what does this all mean?

If Java is so popular - shouldn‚Äôt that be your obvious choice?

To find the answer, let‚Äôs whip through a few key comparisons. Maybe then you‚Äôll have a better idea of whether Python or Java will be the first programming language you learn.

###  **Which is Easier: Java or Python?**

First things first as always üòÇ: ease of learning, and Python wins this round hands down (although Java is still a beginner-friendly language to learn.)

Python was even designed to be easy to understand and easy to use. Because its syntax reads just like English, the whole Python learning experience is completely intuitive and logical.  [It doesn't even take long to learn Python](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-much-time-to-learn-python/) .

Python is particularly popular for data science because it is so easy to organize and analyze. Even those from outside the programming world find it easy to get involved with Python in their day to day work. If you‚Äôre interested in Python because you want to get into data science, a great place to start is this PYTHON COURSE for data science.

Java code, on the other hand,  is far more verbose than Python. It can take ten lines of Java code to express what Python can say with just two. When you‚Äôre setting out to learn the first programming language of your career, less is definitely more.

### **Which is faster: Java or Python**

There‚Äôs a simple answer to this one too: Java is faster than Python because it‚Äôs a compiled language. That means that because it‚Äôs not having to interpret code, the compiling won‚Äôt require processing time and memory.

Java achieves this speed through its ‚ÄòJust-In-Time‚Äô (JIT) compiler, which compiles bytecode into native machine code just before running it.

On the other hand, Python - as an interpreted language - needs a little extra time to put two and two together. That doesn‚Äôt mean Python is slow - far from it. The situation is a little more nuanced than one language being faster, and therefore ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than the other. Speed can also depend on the environment being used. Python is faster when it comes to running in massively parallel mode on GPUs, for example. Python also boots up more quickly. But yes, in general, Java runs faster - and if that matters to you then Java may just be the first programming language you decide to learn.

Before you settle on Java, however, remember that speed shouldn‚Äôt be the most important factor when choosing whether to learn Python or Java in 2021. More important are perhaps ease of learning, job market prospects, and general usefulness as a language.

### **Which is More Popular: Java or Python?**

Of course there are many ways to judge which language is more popular. Number of users. Those who state a preference for one language over the other. Those who want to switch to a given language.

In short, ‚Äúpopular‚Äù is relative. But there‚Äôs no denying the rise of Python, as witnessed in the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer‚Äôs survey.

In 2020,  [MORE PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED TO LEARN PYTHON](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-wanted)  than any other programming language. I don‚Äôt know about you, but when I come out on top in a global survey, I like to think of myself as popular too.*

*The author has not recently come out on top in any global surveys.

In the image below, you can see that a whopping 30% of developers want to pick up Python as their next language. That‚Äôs compared to just 8.8% of developers who are interested in learning Java.

Later on in the survey, the most loved programming language is revealed, and Python comes in at a respectable bronze medal level - as seen in the image below. In this case, Java ranks way down the line as only the 17th most loved language. It also ranks as the 9th most dreaded language - ouch!

And finally - Python is used - often. It‚Äôs the 4th most commonly used programming language, according to the Stack Overflow survey, just ahead of Java.

### **Which has More Jobs Opportunities: Java or Python?**

There are plenty of jobs available for both Python and Java developers - so whichever you choose, you needn‚Äôt be worried about job prospects!

Both Python and Java are key languages for backend web development - which in turn is the most popular field of development among professionals.

Many backend web developers use Python frameworks to help build their backend technology - the two most popular being Django and Flask. Spring is Java‚Äôs most common backend technology.

Machine learning is a booming business and a field where Python in particular really shines. More and more people from different disciplines are using Python to experiment with machine learning in order to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence. The number of jobs in this particular field shows no signs of slowing - so if it‚Äôs job security or ease of access to the job market you‚Äôre after, then Python is an excellent bet.

Python is useful in a whole range of other industries and for many different job descriptions, including developers, analysts, engineers, and teachers. Read:  [WHAT IS PYTHON USED FOR](https://learnpython.com/blog/what-is-python-used-for/)  to understand more about its uses, and to get an idea about the kinds of questions you‚Äôd likely be asked in a Python job interview, have a read of  [15 PYTHON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR DATA SCIENCE JOBS](https://learnpython.com/blog/15-python-interview-questions-for-data-science-jobs/) .

Data Science is an industry that‚Äôs blown everybody‚Äôs mind in 2020 and it‚Äôs set to reach even greater heights in 2021. If you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôre looking to jump on the same gravy train, let‚Äôs take a look at which language is best for data science.

Although Java can be used for data science, and big data in particular, Python is by far the more popular language among data scientists - and for good reason.

Python is powerful and easy to implement, meaning students and researchers find it relatively simple to get the hang of and start using without a huge learning curve.

Python also comes with many different libraries that are specifically designed for machine learning and AI, including Tensorflow, Pytorch, matplotlib, and scikit. These libraries make math, data manipulation and data visualisation a breeze.

The developer community within Python is vibrant and many researchers will share their own libraries on platforms such as Github. This means data scientists who choose to use Python will benefit from a whole wealth of resources and community support.

While data science is still possible with Java, it‚Äôs really a language built for programming more than data work. The best thing about Python is that it helps data scientists carry out complex calculations without needing to become ‚Äòfluent‚Äô in a highly complex programming language.

### **Coding Examples: Java and Python**

If you‚Äôre still not sure whether to learn Python or Java in 2021, perhaps dipping your toe in the water could help you choose which to pick as your new knowledge New Year‚Äôs resolution.

The main difference between the two languages is the complexity of the syntax. While Python is a slick, English-based syntax that makes coding swift and easy, Java uses a more complex syntax that requires more lines of code.

For example, here‚Äôs how you would ask ‚ÄòShould I learn Python or Java in 2021‚Äô in Python:

print("Should I learn Python or Java in 2021")
It‚Äôs quick, it‚Äôs easy, and it‚Äôs closely aligned with everyday English.

On the other hand, Java‚Äôs script is a little more complicated and quite a lot longer:


```js
public class HelloWorld{
 
     public static void main(String []args){
        System.out.println("'Should I learn Python or Java in 2021");
     }
}
``` 

Other tasks within Python are also easier - for example the simple act of opening a file.

With Python, that looks like this:

```py
with open(file_name, "r") as in_file:
```
While with Java, it‚Äôs a little less intuitive:

```js
try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
```

## **The First Programming Language: Java or Python?**

Choosing the first programming language to learn can be difficult and deciding whether to learn Python or Java in 2021 may feel overwhelming! The good news is that you can‚Äôt go wrong with either language. Both are highly popular, useful languages that will set you up for a wide number of roles in a variety of industries.

With Java and Python it‚Äôs a close race, but ultimately our pick has to be Python for its ease of use, its rapidly rising popularity among developers and employers alike, and it‚Äôs amazing library and community of fellow programmers.


Whether you‚Äôre new to the world of programming, considering a language switch, or simply curious if Java or Python is the one to learn in 2021, hopefully this comparison has helped you to make a decision.

Happy coding! Best regards,
