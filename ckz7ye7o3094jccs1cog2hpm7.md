## Netlify February Hackathon | Powered by : Hashnode

# I am sure you had heard about this Hackathon or you got an email about it, right?

### Today I am going to show you my submissions

---------------------------------------------------------------

## I made 3 apps

1. To-Do List
2. Note taking
3. MEGA APP - Whiteboard & Calling App
4. Additional App - Business Idea

Note: All apps are hosted on Netlify. And I noticed recently that my (toolsandapps4us.site) custom domain for using with Netlify when I open like note.toolsandapps4us.site it does not work. I checked the system, DNS is configured but it's not working. So we will use Netlify Subdomain till I fix the issue for now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### So without further ado, let's get into it!
