### Foody is here to help! An food recipe management app!

This application was made for the [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) X Hashnode Hackathon!

### What is Foody?

Foody helps you to add recipes into the app, so if one day you are out of ideas, you can check the application and choose the day's recipe! I hope you have good food 🍕!

If you were happy with your food! Tell me in the comments, would like to hear from you 😋!

### What did I use?

I used many things, it will be hard to list them all, but the most important things are:

- Hasura GraphQL (Back-end)

- Flutter (Front-end)

### How can I try it?

The [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Omar8345/recipe-management-app) link is located at the bottom!

To run the app, you need:

### Pre-requisites

- [Dart & Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/getting-started/index.html#getting-started)

For more, check the [`README.md` on GitHub](https://github.com/Omar8345/recipe-management-app/blob/master/README.md).

### Can I use the app?

Yes, it is free and *open-source under MIT License*, just don't think that you have the code, you own the project and you can do anything, it's my work 🙏🥺!

You can use the app from GitHub for learning purposes, I would like people to learn from my work 😇!
