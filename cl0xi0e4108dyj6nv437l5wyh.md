### What is Foody?

Foody helps you to add recipes into the app, so if one day you are out of ideas, you can check the application and choose the day's recipe! I hope you have good food 🍕!

I used many things, it will be hard to list them all, but the most important things are:

- Hasura GraphQL (Back-end)

- Flutter (Front-end)

### Can I use the app?

Yes, it is free and *open-source under MIT License*, just don't think that you have the code, you own the project and you can do anything, it's my work 🙏🥺!
