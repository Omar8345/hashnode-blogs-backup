# Streamlining Content Management with Gatsby and Cockpit CMS

[**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a modern, blazing fast, and static site generator built using React. It is a great tool for building fast and secure websites with a smooth and dynamic user experience. The reason why Gatsby is so popular among web developers is that it allows you to build a website without the need for a traditional CMS.

In this article, we will be exploring how to integrate Cockpit CMS, a headless CMS, with Gatsby to streamline the content management process.

[Cockpit](https://getcockpit.com/) is a flexible and user-friendly headless CMS that can be used to manage your website's content. It offers a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to manage your website's content and data.

## Setup

Before we dive into integrating Cockpit with Gatsby, we need to set up a Gatsby project. If you already have a Gatsby project, you can skip this section.

To create a new Gatsby project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx gatsby new my-gatsby-project
```

This command will create a new Gatsby project in a directory named `my-gatsby-site`.

## Integrate Cockpit CMS:

To integrate Cockpit with Gatsby, we need to install the `gatsby-source-cockpit` plugin. This plugin will allow us to fetch data from Cockpit and use it in our Gatsby site.

To install the plugin, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd my-gatsby-site
npm install gatsby-source-cockpit
```

Once the plugin is installed, we need to configure it to connect to our Cockpit instance (get an account from [here](https://getcockpit.com/)). To do this, add the following code to your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-cockpit`,
      options: {
        cockpitConfig: {
          baseURL: `https://YOUR_COCKPIT_URL`,
          accessToken: `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Replace `YOUR_COCKPIT_URL` with the URL of your Cockpit instance and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the access token you generated in Cockpit.

Next, we need to create a GraphQL query to fetch data from Cockpit. In your `src/pages/index.js` file, add the following code:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";

const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  const { allCockpitPages } = data;
  return (
    <div>
      {allCockpitPages.edges.map(({ node }) => (
        <div key={node.id}>
          <h2>{node.title}</h2>
          <p>{node.content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allCockpitPages {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          content
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

This query will retrieve all the data from the `Article` collection in Cockpit. You can access the data in your components by using the `data` prop provided by Gatsby. In your `src/pages/index.js` file, you can use the following code to display the title and content of each article:

```javascript
import React from "react"

export default ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    {data.allCockpitArticle.edges.map(({ node }, index) => (
      <div key={index}>
        <h2>{node.title}</h2>
        <p>{node.content}</p>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
)
```

This code loops through the `edges` array in the `data.allCockpitArticle` object and displays the title and content of each article using a React component.

Finally, you can run `gatsby develop` in your terminal to start the development server and see the data from Cockpit being displayed on your website.

Now, you have successfully integrated Cockpit CMS with Gatsby ðŸŽ‰!

## Outro

In conclusion, combining Gatsby with Cockpit CMS is a powerful way to streamline the process of managing your website's content. With Gatsby's fast performance and Cockpit's flexible and user-friendly content management system, you can easily create a dynamic website that can handle large amounts of traffic.
