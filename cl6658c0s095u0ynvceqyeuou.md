## How to Add Advanced Analytics to Medusa with Next.js and Matomo

**[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/)** is an open source headless commerce, it makes it easy for developers to create awesome online commerce shops in no time! **Medusa** aims to provide developers with a great experience and limitless customization capabilities. Well, **Medusa** is well known for being a **Shopify** open source alternative.

In this **guide**, you will be integrating **Matomo** which allows you to get your website (store) analytics, such as **average session time** (how long a user stays on the page), etc. 

You will be integrating **Matomo** with a **Next.js** app, where itâ€™s the same if you use **Next.js** to build and create your **Medusa** store.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, the following requirements are required:

- A **Matomo** account - Get an account from [here](https://matomo.org/start-free-analytics-trial/)
- **Node** V14.0 or higher - Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)** or **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)** (*SQLite* is only for getting started; *PostgreSQL* is recommended)
- **[Redis](https://redis.io/download/)** server up and running

More information can be found here on [***How-to* Set up your development environment**](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/).

## Setting up your Medusa Store

This section is separated into 3 parts as follows:

- *Setting up the* **Medusa Server**
- *Setting up the* **Medusa Store**
- *Setting up the* **Medusa Admin Dashboard**

### 1. Setting up the Medusa Server

- Start by creating a new **Medusa** project and seeding it:

```bash
medusa new my-medusa-store --seed
```

- Move into the projectâ€™s directory and start the **server**:

```bash
cd my-medusa-store
medusa develop
```

Now, your **Medusa** server is running on port **9000**.

To test it out, use your browser and go to [`localhost:9000/store/products`](http://localhost:9000/store/products) and you should get a **JSON** response like this:

### 2. Setting up the Medusa Store

- Start by creating the **Next.js Medusa Storefront** and changing the directory:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront
cd my-medusa-storefront
```

- Next, get your **environment** **variables** ready:

```bash
mv .env.template .env.local
```

- Finally, start your **Next.js** **Medusa** store:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, your **Next.js Medusa Store** is running ðŸŽ‰ on port `8000`

You can test it out by checking one of the sample products in [`/products/t-shirt`](http://localhost:8000/products/t-shirt) and you can see the sample **Medusa T-Shirt** for **â‚¬19.50**.

### 3. Setting up the Medusa Admin Dashboard and making some things

- Start by cloning theÂ [Admin GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/admin)Â and changing the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin
cd medusa-admin
```

- Next, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- Finally, start the **admin dashboard**:

```bash
npm run start
```

Now the **Medusa Admin Dashboard** is running on port `7000`, head over to [`localhost:7000`](http://localhost:7000) and log in with the user details:

```
email: admin@medusa-test.com
password: supersecret
```

Once you are logged in, get started by creating some products.

So head over to **Products** and create a **new product**:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181084550-6ceef02e-d1ae-43b7-b507-ee6209b56401.png)

After creating your products, letâ€™s create some **collections**, go to **Collections** and click **New Collection**.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181084632-5a3b7d3c-a23e-47b6-83bc-d7429e3a969d.png)

Now, head back over to **Products** and assign a collection to each product like this:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181084702-eab47e75-fc13-4127-a76a-8d404fe00a38.png)

Now, your products can be **viewed** and **filtered** by your users.

You can test it out by going to [`localhost:8000/store`](http://localhost:8000/store) and you can see the products you created and filter them.

## Integrating Matomo to get Analytics

Open your **Matomo** Dashboard, if you havenâ€™t used **Matomo** before, you would be given 4 options to setup **Matomo**, choose **Tracking Code** and copy the **JS code** inside the `<script>` tag like this:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181084762-50272506-11c9-44b6-a9e6-d1aa1d1af970.png)

Or, if you canâ€™t find the setup instructions for **Matomo** on login, head over to **Settings** > **Websites** > **Tracking Code** and scroll a little down until you find the **JS tracking code**, copy the **JS** code inside the `<script>` tag.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181084834-fc7758bf-783a-46f2-826d-21843f942d64.png)

Now, letâ€™s integrate **Matomo**, open your **Next.js Medusa Store** using your favorite **IDE** (Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) and head over to `src/pages`, and start by editing the `_app.tsx` file.

First of all, you will use `Script` to run the **JS code**, so use this line of code to import `Script`:

```tsx
import Script from "next/script";
```

And now, inside your `return()` include a `<Script>` tag with the `strategy` set as `afterInteractive` and optionally the `id` to `matomoAnalytics` so that you can refer to this later. Be sure to add 1 angle brackets (`<>`) and mention an `</>` at the end of `return()`, final code should be like this:

```tsx
<>
	<Script strategy="afterInteractive" id="matomoAnalytics">
		{`
		// your code here
		`}
	</Script>
</>
```

Now, letâ€™s test it out, so just refresh the app, and you can see that if you go to the **Matomo** dashboard you can see the analytics start showing!

## Testing

Now, try visiting the Medusa Store, you will find active sessions with country, etc.

Try visiting [`/`](http://localhost:8000/) and then [`/store`](http://localhost:8000/store) and then head over to the **Matomo** Dashboard, click on **Visitors** > **Visits Log** and you will find some information, including **OS**, **browser**, **region**, **IP address**, **pages visited**, etc.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68811721/181085036-567f79b1-94f7-446f-b627-132c5d85cd20.png)

Also, you can head over to **Real-time** and check visits in **real-time**, you can check **Devices** and **Software** to analyze user data, and you can do **even more** with **Matomo**!

## Conclusion

Now, you have **successfully** integrated **Matomo** Analytics with your **Medusa Store**. Now you can get Analytics data such as average session time and more from the **Matomo** Dashboard! Where **Next.js** with **TypeScript** was used to build and create the storefront and the `<Script>` tag was used to run the **Matomo** tracking **JS** code to get analytics.
