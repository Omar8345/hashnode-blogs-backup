## Everyone belongs to tech

### Everyone belongs to tech, me, you, and everyone

### Even women, like your sister

This blog was made to support the #WomenWhoCode campaign.


Today we will ask 2 questions:

- **Why everyone belongs to tech?**
- **Why especially women belongs to tech?**

### Why everyone belongs to tech?

Everyone belongs to tech, it is public for everyone. Like public transport and the metro belongs to all people, including people with special needs. So everyone belongs to tech, everyone can be a programmer, designer, or anything else no-matter what! So why do even women do ðŸ¤“?

Tech is for everyone, such important reasons:

- ***Easy to learn***
- ***Starting from any age***
- ***Everyone benefits from it***
- ***No one owns it - No one can delete it***
- ***Nevertheless, unlimited reasons***

So just it is like public transport, everyone owns it, not an special authority or person, even Google or Microsoft don't own technology ðŸ¤£! So technology owns everyone, so I benefit from tech, you 'n everyone.

### Why especially women belongs to tech?

As we said, tech is for everyone! Everyone means everyone, men, women, kids, and even babies ðŸ˜…. So women have their rights to get into tech, not like most people and fathers, as they suggest their girls and general women to find another specialty to work in and improve themself in, but they can start into coding, without issues as they belong to everyone no matter what!!!

So guys, please stop thinking or seeing that women cannot be professional programmers and change the future everyone has a brain, everyone can think, human have no limits, you can improve your thinking and have unlimited limits of thinking for your life, so even if women or men, anyone can be a programmer, astronaut, or dive into any specialty, everyone!

### We have reached the end of this blog. I hope you liked this #WomenWhoCode blog.

## What I say:

### Congratulations women, keep doing it ðŸŽ‰
