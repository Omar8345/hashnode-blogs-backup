Learning in multiple ways help increase your knowledge, as each way of learning, gives you different knowledge and learning. Like listening gives you listening ability and then you can practice listening. Let's give some examples.

1. Math --> Watch videos and keep practicing questions, which then may answer questions in your mind.

2. English --> Listen & Watch lessons on *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Learn+English)* or other platform like *[Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/)*

3. Science --> Watch educational and fun videos which makes learning espically science much fun like *[It's AumSum Time](https://www.youtube.com/c/AumSum)* and *[Peekaboo Kidz](https://www.youtube.com/c/PeekabooKids/)*

Told by : Phil Collins - Drummer

Most kids, and normal people *adults* do teach things which they learned, which actually connects minds and who is teaching, feels more comfortable, and even if he did understand something wrong, he will be still corrected by others.

Told by : Harvey Mackay - American Businessman

Another great way to become a more effective learner is to use relational learning, which involves relating new information to things that you already know.


For example, if you are learning a new language, you might associate the new vocabulary and grammar you are learning with what you already know about your native language or other languages you may already speak.

### 6. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes

Told by : David Packard - Electrical Engineer

For example, if you are learning a new language, you shouldn't be afraid of making mistakes, as making mistakes is same as learning new things, as if a point is in your mind, it can be corrected which also means **"learning a new thing"**.
