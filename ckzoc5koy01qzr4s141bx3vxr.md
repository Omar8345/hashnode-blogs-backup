Told by : Steve Jobs - Co-Founder of Apple

Let me tell you a story which happend with me in real life, when I was young in school, when a new language to learn was mandatory on me, I was being asked to choose between German/French . I choose German as Germany is full of lots of coders, which then I am able to get a job opportunity. I realized after a few weeks of starting learning, although I started learning German from home before start of school to get an idea and to be confident and comfortable while learning a new language for me which is German. When I was learning German, I feel that I focus more on German and have more interest to learn German rather than like learning English Grammar like Past Perfect or Present Simple. I felt that my mind is more open and more excited to learn new things.! ( *this story happend in real life* )

Learning in multiple ways help increase your knowledge, as each way of learning, gives you different knowledge and learning. Like listening gives you listening ability and then you can practice listening. Let's give some examples.

1. Math --> Watch videos and keep practicing questions, which then may answer questions in your mind.

2. English --> Listen & Watch lessons on *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Learn+English)* or other platform like *[Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/)*

3. Science --> Watch educational and fun videos which makes learning espically science much fun like *[It's AumSum Time](https://www.youtube.com/c/AumSum)* and *[Peekaboo Kidz](https://www.youtube.com/c/PeekabooKids/)*

Told by : Phil Collins - Drummer

When I was young, my father was advising me to study what I took in the day, each day. And then I come and teach him what I had learned today. I was feeling comfortable with this as this makes me feel more like a teacher and even inspires me with more energy to learn. As teaching someone else makes you discuss ideas and share ideas too. Which connects minds.

Told by : Harvey Mackay - American Businessman

Another great way to become a more effective learner is to use relational learning, which involves relating new information to things that you already know.


For example, if you are learning a new language, you might associate the new vocabulary and grammar you are learning with what you already know about your native language or other languages you may already speak.

### 6. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes

Told by : David Packard - Electrical Engineer

When I was young learning German for the first time, although I didn't do such lots of mistakes, but when I do, I feel happy too. As if you make mistakes, you are learning something new which you don't know, or you know, but you know it ***'wrong'*** . So I was feeling happy and the teacher feels happy too as I am learning more overtime and you're maybe not feeling about that. So I wasn't afraid to make mistakes, I was happy.!
