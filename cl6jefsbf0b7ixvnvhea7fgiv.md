## How to setup authentication with Node.js CLI and Prisma

Hello there! Today we will be integrating **user authentication** with your *Node.js CLI*, we will also cover how to create one, and we will make an *API* to authenticate user details! Without wasting such more time, let's goooo!

## Creating our CLI

Start by creating a folder and initializing our project ðŸŽ‰:

```bash
mkdir mycli
cd mycli
npm init -y
```

Now, let's make a test make a test command like `mycli-help`, so to do that, create an `index.js` file and paste the following code:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log("Hello World!");
```

Simply, what we are doing here is actually adding the **shebang** which actually they serve as a way for your operating system program loader to locate and use toe parse the correct interpreter for your executable file. This only works in Unix Systems though.

> In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.
>
> From: **Wikipedia**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

And we are simply priting in the console `Hello World!`, so let's edit our `package.json`, so add this `scripts` JSON keypair:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
```

And add this `bin` which tells the app which file should be run once this command is executed:

```json
  "bin": {
    "mycli-help": "index.js"
  }
```

Now, let's install the **CLI** and give it a try:

```bash
npm i . -g
mycli-help
```

You should get `Hello World!`, now let's uninstall it and work on our *API* ðŸš€:

```bash
npm uninstall mycli -g
```

## Setting up our API + Prisma

Start by creating a new **Next.js** app using `npx`:

```bash
npx create-next-app
cd my-auth-api
```

After that, let's setup our **Prisma** scheme and our *MySQL* database, so first of all let's get the database, for this guide, we will use [**PlanetScale**](https://planetscale.com) or generally a *MySQL* database, it should be the same process, just update your **Scheme configs**.

So, head over to *PlanetScale* and create a new *database* if you don't have one yet, it will take a few minutes to get ready, just be paitent, once done, click on **Connect**, choose *Prisma* from the dropdown menu and copy the `.env` file content:

Now, let's create a `.env` file and paste the enviorment variables you just copied from **PlanetScale**. Now, let's setup *Prisma* ðŸš€:

```bash
yarn add prisma @prisma/client
```

Now, let's checkout our `prisma/schema.prisma` and update the configs, etc. to the following:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["referentialIntegrity"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
  referentialIntegrity = "prisma"
}
```

Now, let's define our `Account` Model, like this:

```prisma
model Account {
  id Int @default(autoincrement()) @id
  username String @unique
  password String
}
```

Now, let's sync our **database** ðŸš€:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Now, your **database** is in *sync* with your schema, now let's work on our **API**.

Now, remove `pages/api/hello.js` file and let's create a file in `pages/api/` called `auth.js`, so it should be `pages/api/auth.js`

Now, place this code in the `auth.js` file:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

export default function handler(req, res) {
  if (!req.body.username || !req.body.password) {
    res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Please provide username and password'
    })
  }
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
  const findAccount = async (username, password) => {
    const account = await prisma.account.findFirst({
      where: {
        username,
        password: password,
      },
    })
    if (!account) {
      return res.json({
        status: 'error authentication failed'
      })
    } else {
      return res.json({
        status: 'authorized',
        accountAuthorized: username
      })
    }
  }
  findAccount(req.body.username, req.body.password)
}

```

Simply, what we are doing here, first of all we are importing the `PrismaClient` to use **Prisma**:

```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
```

And after that, we are making the **API** and defining the *Prisma Client* so that we can use **Prisma** in the *API*, also we are checking if username and password is provided in JSON:

```js
  if (!req.body.username || !req.body.password) {
    res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Please provide username and password'
    })
  }
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

After creating the *Prisma* client, let's use it to check if a record in our **model** matches with the credentials sent in a JSON request which will be sent from our *CLI*, so we use `findFirst` to check for a matching record and don't worry, as long as the username is unique with the help of `@unique`, same passwords but for different accounts won't effect, so after checking for a matching record, we either get `null` for the value of `account` because there is no such record matching, so we use an condition to return a response in JSON telling that there is an error authenticating the user, and otherwise, we will get the record details including `id`, `username`, `password` in `account`, but we don't need all of this, so we return a response in JSON with a message telling that authentication was successful and we provide the `username` which has been successfully authorized for confirmation:

```js
const findAccount = async (username, password) => {
    const account = await prisma.account.findFirst({
      where: {
        username,
        password: password,
      },
    })
    if (!account) {
      return res.json({
        status: 'error authentication failed'
      })
    } else {
      return res.json({
        status: 'authorized',
        accountAuthorized: username
      })
    }
  }
```

Now, we will run the function and provide `username` and `password`, which are in `res.body`:

```js
  findAccount(req.body.username, req.body.password)
```

Now, the **API** is good to go! Just run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Authenticating the user from CLI

Now, we got an *API* running and waiting for someone to call! We have to get 2 things from the user, a (username) and a (password), so let's code it inside our `index.js`:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var args = process.argv.slice(2);
var username = args[0];
var password = args[1];

if (!username || !password) {
    console.log('Please provide username and password');
    console.log('Usage: mycli-auth <username> <password>');
    process.exit(1);
}

var request = require('request');
var options = {
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth',
    method: 'POST',
    json: {
        username: username,
        password: password
    }
}
request(options, function (error, response, body) {
    if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
        console.log(body);
    }
}
);
```

So what we are doing is that we are checking if username and password is provided when executing the command, so if both or one of the credentials aren't provided, we will log an error with expecteed usage and exit.

If they are both provided, we import `request` and set options where the API is running accepting JSON requests, setting the method to `POST`, and in the JSON which we will send, we provide `username` and `password`, and then if we get a JSON back with status code `200` which means **OK**, we return the JSON to the user in the console, which is fine, as long as our JSON response is human readable and understandable, you may configure this if you wish ðŸ˜‰.

Now, before trying it, just install `request`:

```bash
npm install request
```

Now, just edit `mycli-help` to `mycli-auth` in `bin` in the `package.json` file, it should be like this:

```json
  "bin": {
    "mycli-auth": "index.js"
  }
```

Now, test it out! But first run `npx prisma studio` and go to http://localhost:5000 and check the `Account` model, add a user record which you will be using to authenticate, done? Now:

```bash
npm i . -g
mycli-auth <username> <password>
```

And.... congrats ðŸŽ‰, you have successfully made your authentication feature!

## Try it - No setup!

Just install from NPM:

```bash
npm i nodejs-cli-prisma-auth -g
```

And try authorizing with the sample admin user:

```bash
mycli-auth admin supersecret123
```

And kaboom ðŸ’¥! Even here is the GitHub Repo: [Omar8345/nodejs-prisma-auth](https://github.com/Omar8345/nodejs-prisma-auth/)!
